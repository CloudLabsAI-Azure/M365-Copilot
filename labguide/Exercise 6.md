   Given below are the features of each of the following services of **Microsoft 365 Copilot**:

    - **Graph Connectors in Microsoft 365 Copilot:** These connectors enable Copilot to access data from **Microsoft Graph**, a cloud-based service that provides a unified programmability model to access data in Microsoft 365. This feature allows Copilot to source information from a wide range of Microsoft services and apps, enriching its responses with contextually relevant data.

    - **Intelligent Search:** This feature uses AI technology to streamline the process of searching for information across Microsoft 365 apps. Instead of merely returning results based on keywords, Intelligent Search understands the context of the search query, providing more relevant results. It can also suggest answers to questions or direct users to specific documents or data points.

    - **Microsoft 365 Chat:** **Microsoft 365 Copilot** enhances the chat experience by providing real-time assistance. It can generate responses to questions, provide suggestions, and even automate certain tasks within the chat. This feature can help streamline communications and increase productivity.

Remember, changes to the admin settings may take up to 24 hours to reflect. This knowledge will allow you to effectively manage and tailor the Copilot experience to best suit your organizational requirements.

### Task 3: Change update channel of Microsoft 365 Apps to enable Copilot (Read Only)

One of the benefits of Microsoft 365 Apps is that Microsoft provides new (and updated) features for Office apps, such as Excel and Word, regularly. You can control how often the users in your organization get these new features by specifying the update channel. In addition to new features, update channels provide, as needed, security and non-security updates regularly, every month. Non-security updates provide fixes for known issues and provide stability or performance improvements for Office.

Contoso Ltd, a leading IT Consultancy firm, has decided to opt for the Monthly Enterprise Channel for their Microsoft 365 Apps. This decision was taken after a thorough assessment of the companyâ€™s needs and understanding the benefits of the Monthly Enterprise Channel. Contoso Ltd is a dynamic organization that requires regular updates to keep their operations running smoothly and securely, but also needs stability and predictability in their software environment. The Monthly Enterprise Channel perfectly fits their needs as it provides new features, security and non-security updates on a predictable monthly schedule. Contoso appreciates the fact that these updates occur only once a month, allowing their IT team to plan and manage these updates efficiently. Furthermore, the Monthly Enterprise Channel offers Contoso a good balance between receiving the latest updates and having a stable, secure software environment.

In addition to the Monthly Enterprise Channel, Contoso Ltd has also decided to utilize Cloud updates as its management solution. This strategic decision is aimed at maximizing the benefits of cloud-based technologies in their software management processes. With Cloud updates, Contoso can enjoy a more streamlined, efficient, and automated update process. This solution reduces the manual intervention required from the IT team, freeing them up to focus on more strategic tasks. Cloud updates provide real-time access to the latest updates, ensuring that Contoso's Microsoft 365 Apps are always up-to-date with the latest features and security patches. Moreover, the cloud-based solution allows Contoso to manage updates across multiple devices and locations seamlessly, a feature that is particularly beneficial for a global corporation like Contoso Ltd.

## Conclusion: 

In conclusion, Contoso Ltd's decision to opt for the Monthly Enterprise Channel for their Microsoft 365 Apps and Cloud updates as their management solution is a strategic move that aligns perfectly with their business needs. The Monthly Enterprise Channel provides a balanced, predictable update schedule that ensures stability and security, while also offering the latest features. The Cloud updates complement this by providing an efficient, automated, and real-time update management process that can be tailored to meet Contoso's specific needs.
