## Task 2: Implementing Sensitivity Labels with Purview 

Sensitivity labels are a way of categorizing and protecting your data based on its level of confidentiality and the impact to your business if it is leaked or misused. You can use sensitivity labels to apply metadata tags and encryption settings to your data sources, columns, tables, and files. Purview is a service that helps you manage and govern your data across your organization.

CoPilot is a system that aids in the management and control of data within an organization. It can work in conjunction with Sensitivity Labels to classify and protect sensitive information. Sensitivity Labels are attributes that can be applied to documents and emails to classify them based on the content sensitivity. These labels can trigger protective actions like encryption or visual markings. Once a sensitivity label is applied to content, it stays with the content regardless of where it's stored or with whom it's shared.

### Understanding Sensitivity labels

Sensitivity labels in Microsoft 365 allow organizations to classify and protect their sensitive content. Here's some information on what these labels represent in Contoso Ltd:

- **Confidential:**
The "Confidential" sensitivity label is used when information is meant to be restricted to a specific group of people within an organization. This label is typically used for data such as employee records, internal policies, or strategic plans. Unauthorized disclosure of this information can lead to potential damage to the organization, but not to the same extent as that classified as "Highly Confidential."

- **Highly Confidential:**
The "Highly Confidential" sensitivity label is assigned to the most sensitive information that, if disclosed, could result in severe harm to the organization. This might include trade secrets, legal documents, or personally identifiable information (PII) such as social security numbers, credit card information, or health records. Extra security measures, like encryption, are often applied to these documents to prevent unauthorized access or sharing.

- **Internal:**
The "Internal" sensitivity label is used for information that is not intended for public view but doesn't necessarily contain sensitive data. This could include internal newsletters, meeting minutes, or project plans. This label serves as a reminder to employees that the information should not be shared outside the organization, though its disclosure wouldn't cause significant harm.

- **Public**
The "Public" sensitivity label is applied to information that can be freely shared both inside and outside the organization. This information poses no risk if disclosed and is often intended for public consumption. Examples could include press releases, marketing materials, or public-facing reports.

   >**Note:** Remember, sensitivity labels are a tool for managing and protecting data, but they are most effective when combined with user education about data handling and security best practices.

### Task 2.1: Applying Sensitivity label to Documents.

- Navigate to [Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com), then click on Word in the Application launcher. In the new tab, click on "Blank document".

## Task 3: Understand Semantic Index (Read Only)

Microsoft technologies underpin Copilot for Microsoft 365, with a key role played by the Semantic Index. This vast knowledge graph, connecting billions of objects, concepts, and relationships, introduces a new dimension to data understanding within Microsoft 365.

The Semantic Index for Copilot constructs an intricate map of your personal and company data, establishing important connections and identifying significant relationships. This design is much like the inner workings of the human brain. It goes beyond the confines of keyword search by interpreting and encoding the conceptual relationships between data elements. By analyzing your Microsoft Graph data - encompassing emails, documents, calendars, chats, and more - and working synergistically with LLMs, it delivers personalized, relevant, and actionable responses.

## Key Features

1. **Rich Knowledge Base:**
   - The Semantic Index is powered by Microsoft Graph, enhancing Microsoft 365 search capabilities.
   - Security is paramount, ensuring that users only access data within their designated permissions.

2. **Contextual Responses:**
   - Leveraging individual and company data, Semantic Index enables Copilot to provide pertinent and actionable responses.
   - Through a secure and compliant process, it constructs a sophisticated map of relationships, respecting user privacy.

## How Copilot Uses Semantic Index

1. **Vectorized Indices:**
   - Advances keyword matching with vectorized indices, fostering conceptual understanding.
   - Multi-dimensional spaces facilitate semantic similarity, moving beyond rigid exact matches. These vectors enable Copilot to handle a broader set of search queries beyond “exact match.”

2. **Semantic Search:**
   - Captures semantic meaning, comprehending relationships between diverse forms of words.
   - Enhances understanding of sentences, snippets, and documents, broadening search capabilities. Semantic Search uses vectors to understand relationships, capturing synonyms and expanding the scope of searchable information.

3. **Grounding and Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
   - Implements grounding, associating words with real-world entities for nuanced understanding.
   - Enhances Copilot's intelligence in understanding user intent and connecting inputs to broader meanings. Grounding is a common approach in NLP systems that associates words and phrases with real-world entities that the AI understands.

## Semantic Relationships

Microsoft's Semantic Index enables grounding through its predefined knowledge graph that contains billions of concepts interconnected by semantic relationships. A semantic relationship refers to a typed connection between two entities or concepts that encodes some meaningful association between them. The graph contains semantic data on people, places, organizations, products, concepts, and the relationships between them all. This graph provides the semantic "understanding" of words, phrases, and entities that Microsoft products use.

The Semantic Index relies on a predefined knowledge graph that features various semantic relationships, such as "is-a," "part-of," "works-for," etc. These relationships enable Copilot to infer new knowledge, enriching language grounding and contextual understanding.

- **"is-a":** Used for categorization or inheritance (e.g., "dog is-a mammal").
- **"part-of":** Describes composition or properties of an entity (e.g., "wheel part-of car").
- **"works-for":** Associates an employee with an employer (e.g., "John works-for Microsoft").
- **"located-in":** Relates an entity to its geographic location (e.g., "Paris located-in France").
- **"causes":** Connects a cause to an effect (e.g., "rain causes wet").

Semantic Index uses billions of these structured relationships between entities, concepts, and data to encode human-like understanding of the connections between things. This web of semantic relationships is what enables context and language grounding.

## Customer Data and Security

Semantic Index doesn't change a customer's data. It simply indexes an organization's Microsoft 365 data across Microsoft 365 apps. The permissions model within your Microsoft 365 tenant can help ensure that data doesn't unintentionally leak between users, groups, and tenants. The Semantic Index only presents data that each individual can access using the same underlying controls for data access used in other Microsoft 365 services. Semantic Index honors the user identity-based access boundary so that the grounding process only accesses content that the current user is authorized to access. Data generated by the Semantic Index remains within your company’s tenant, and complies with your security, compliance, identity, and privacy policies and processes. The Semantic Index works only with content to which your users already have permission and doesn't affect storage quotas.

## Benefits for Users

1. **Deeper Contextual Understanding:**
   - Parses intent beyond literal words, comprehending organizational jargon and language nuances.
   - Contextualizes broad queries, interprets ambiguous instructions, and links concepts across domains.

2. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - New content is continually indexed. This action constantly expands the Semantic Index knowledge graph, which increases its ability to understand an ever growing number of objects, concepts, and the relationships between them. In doing so, Copilot for Microsoft 365's contextual comprehension continues to grow more powerful over time.

## Incorporating Third-Party Information

Graph connectors empower the integration of external data, enriching Copilot with a diverse range of content. Microsoft ensures that the indexing of Graph connectors' data maintains access controls, providing an expanded and searchable content landscape.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Semantic Index is a pivotal component empowering Copilot for Microsoft 365. It not only provides a foundation for intelligent code and text generation but also ensures continuous improvement and integration with third-party data, enhancing user experiences over time.
