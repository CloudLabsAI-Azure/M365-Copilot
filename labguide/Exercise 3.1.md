# Exercise 3.1: Preparing for M365 Copilot Deployment

In this exercise we will walkthrough a comprehensive journey, skillfully preparing users for the deployment of M365 Copilot through three interconnected tasks. Efficient collaboration and information management within an organization hinge on the meticulous organization of SharePoint sites. We will delve into the critical process of structuring SharePoint teams and files for optimal functionality and productivity. Through meticulous organization, SharePoint becomes a powerhouse for streamlined information retrieval and enhanced collaboration. By navigating through a structured "Finance" SharePoint site and leveraging the capabilities of Microsoft 365 Copilot, this exercise illuminates the importance of organized information architecture in driving organizational efficiency and productivity.

Safeguarding sensitive data is paramount for any organization's security and compliance efforts. We will also delve into the implementation of sensitivity labels using Microsoft Purview, a pivotal tool for categorizing and protecting data based on its level of confidentiality. By establishing sensitivity labels such as "Confidential" and "Highly Confidential," organizations can ensure that sensitive information is appropriately protected and accessed only by authorized personnel. This exercise provides a comprehensive guide to creating and publishing sensitivity labels, showcasing the integration of robust data protection measures within the organizational framework.

## Task 1: Organizing SharePoint Teams and Files

Organizing your SharePoint site is crucial for efficient collaboration and information management within your organization. A well-organized and structured SharePoint site can help Microsoft 365 Copilot by making it easier to find and retrieve relevant information. When the site is organized and the content is properly tagged and categorized, it makes it easier for me to search and retrieve the information you need. This can help me provide you with more accurate and relevant responses to your queries. Additionally, a well-organized SharePoint site can help improve collaboration and productivity within your organization by making it easier for everyone to find and access the information they need.

Let's explore the "Finance" SharePoint site we have set up for Contoso Ltd. This site serves as a collaborative platform integrated with Microsoft 365, facilitating seamless document management and team collaboration.

   - The **Human Resources SharePoint site** is a crucial resource for any organization, as it serves as a central repository for various Human Resources (HR) related documents and information. The structure of this site is designed to ensure easy access and efficient navigation of all its contents. 
   
      ![](./media/hrsite1.1.png)

   - The first part of the HR site is the 'Policies Library.' This library is an organized collection of all HR-related policies and procedures, which are important documents that guide the conduct and operations of employees within the organization. These include, but are not limited to, rules and regulations regarding behavior, dress code, and usage of internet and email.

      ![](./media/hrsite1.2.png)

   - The Policies Library is further divided into different folders for effective organization. For example, there is an 'Employee Policies' folder, which contains files like the 'Code of Conduct,' 'Dress Code Policy,' and 'Internet and Email Policy.' These files are essentially documents that detail the organization's expected codes of behavior, dress standards, and rules for using internet and email services.

      ![](./media/hrsite1.4.png)

   - We can even ask Copilot regarding the Policies of our Organization from the **Human Resources** SharePoint site. Please use the following prompt.

      ```
      Create an FAQ based on Code of Conduct Policy.docx
      ```
